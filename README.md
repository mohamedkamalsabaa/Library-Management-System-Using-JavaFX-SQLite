# Library-Management-System-Using-JavaFX-SQLite
The Library Management System is a desktop application built using JavaFX and SQLite. It allows librarians to manage the inventory of books in a library by adding, updating, and deleting books. The system also supports searching for books by title, author, genre, or publisher and displays the details of each book.

This project demonstrates how to build a user-friendly interface with JavaFX, employ the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern, and utilize SQLite as the database backend for managing library records.
